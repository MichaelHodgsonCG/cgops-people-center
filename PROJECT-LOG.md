## [2026-07-15] Position vocabulary sync (CGOPS -> People Center)
**Shipped:**   People Center positions now sync from the CGOPS Operational Center master instead of being a hand-seeded copy. New Data Sources → Positions tab: "Sync from CGOPS" button + a grid to toggle show-in-pickers / roster-eligibility / default kind per position. `people_center_sync_positions_from_cgops()` links by external_ref, refreshes CGOPS-owned fields, and materializes new CGOPS positions hidden+ineligible until curated. Pickers filter to curated positions; `Needs Position Review` placeholder hidden. Adding an HQ position = add once in CGOPS, sync, toggle on.
**Roadmap:**   Position vocabulary sharing -> complete (code shipped; migration 20260715120000 applied + verified on live project)
**Decisions:** Sync two tables over one shared table (ADR 0012) — the two lists are different curations (membership/granularity/columns), so sharing re-encodes the divergence + forces a live FK migration + couples PC to CGOPS lifecycle; field ownership (CGOPS=name/desc, PC=config) makes bi-directional editing safe; PC-side pull, not a CGOPS trigger, to keep PC logic off CGOPS's write path.
**Blockers:**  none
**Next:**      Deploy frontend; run first "Sync from CGOPS" (admin, in-app) to materialize the CGOPS catalog; toggle on HQ positions and fix Supervisor roster-eligibility drift in the same panel.

## [2026-07-15] Manual add + admin-confirmed Push linking
**Shipped:**   Add people by hand from the Directory — HQ (active, off-roster) and candidates (not-yet-hired), alongside incoming hires. A roster sync that name-matches an unlinked manual profile now holds it as a "possible match" (Data Sources → Pending links) for an admin to Confirm (links Push identity, preserves manual data) or Reject (imports as new). Candidates stay off the org chart. Confirmed answer to the sync-behavior question: uploads add + link, never merge/overwrite leadership-entered data.
**Roadmap:**   Manual people & Push linking -> complete (code); deploy + migration -> in progress (owner running)
**Decisions:** Admin-confirmed linking over auto-by-name (avoids false merges on common names); `candidate` status + `off_roster` flag over reusing active/incoming (distinguishes prospects and HQ; keeps sync from flagging HQ as missing); linking preserves manual data, only stamps `external_refs.push_source_key` + fills an empty assignment (upholds ADR 0005 "never overwrite"); reuse existing source_key correlation rather than a new link table.
**Blockers:**  Migration 20260709090000 must be applied to the CGOPS Platform Supabase project before the new UI works on live data (owner deploying).
**Next:**      Owner deploys + runs migration, then returns with feedback.
